      "There were a couple things I learned doing this hw.  First I got much more familiar with displaying certain values of a number in python. For example displaying the forces in Scientific notation while only using 2 sig figs after the decimal. This was covered during the lectue but I had forgotten how to do that and needed a refresher.  Also I didn't know that python would turn a variable into a long if you overflowed the previous integer type without even a warning or anything.  \n",
